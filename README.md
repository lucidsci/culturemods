Oxygen cell culture models.  Currently implements a 1D kinetics model of change in O2 over time in well media from saturation after a step change in oxygen consumption by a cell monolayer at the bottom.

Example commands.


python3 cli.py o2-at-position-by-ocr --position 1.25 --vol 100 10 50 100 150

This will plot the O2 at 1.25mm above thee well bottom for a media volume of 100uL for OCRs of 10,50,100 and 150 fmols/mm2/s
